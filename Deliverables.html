<h1>Deliverable 1</h1>
<p><strong>Data Formats and Transformations I (one-mode)</strong></p>
<p><strong>For this deliverable you will need one publication dataset of a topic and time frame of your interest. You can create this file from Scopus as discussed in class.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please explain the dataset used indicating the time frame, the topic and other inclusion criteria like type of publication, for example.</strong></p>
<p>For this exercise I decided to analyze authorship data on articles regarding self-control. I limited my search to recent articles published in psychology journals.</p>
<p>I will load the data and perform some cleaning.</p>

<p><br> 4. <strong>How are points 2 and 3 similar or different? In what ways?</strong></p>
<p>They are actually quite different. This is because the most prolific authors do not necessarily collaborate with the same people all the time, whereas co-authors might be less prolific individually, but more so combined. This really highlights how studying units individually does not reveal the same insights that would be revealed by studying the links between these units.</p>

<p>There is a publication with 129 coauthors, the title of which is A Multisite Preregistered Paradigmatic Test of the Ego-Depletion Effect. This makes sense, given that this is a huge paper where multiple labs collaborated to test a multi-site replication of a contentious finding (ego depletion). From what I’ve heard (I’ve never read the paper myself), this was a crucial publication in discreting this idea and finding that the finding does not replicate as it should.</p>

<li><strong>How are points 2 and 3 similar or different? In what ways?</strong></li>

<p>Very different! Individual level productivity need not align with the amount of co-authors in a given publication.</p>

<h1>Deliverable 3: Data Formats and Transformations I (two-mode to one-mode transformations)</h1>
<p><strong>For this deliverable you will need the same publication dataset of a topic and time frame of your interest as employed in deliverables 1 and 2.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In this example, you will start with the two-mode network you created in deliverable 2.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Conduct the two-mode to one-mode transformation retaining co-authors.</strong></li>

<p>See above. Here’s the code once more:</p>

<li><strong>What is the meaning of the diagonal in this one-mode transformed matrix? What is the off-diagonal telling us?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The diagonal reflects the number of articles that author has published. The off diagonal tells us the number of publications the author corresponding to that row shares with the author corresponding to that column. For example, the number at the third row and second column (<span class="math inline">\(x_{32}\)</span> = 2) corresponds to the number of shared publications of Zhang Y. and Sun X..</p>
<p><strong>3. Compare the resulting number of authors in this dataset with the total number of authors you obtained in deliverable 1. Are these numbers the same? If they are not, elaborate on why are they different? If they are the same, also elaborate on why they are the same.</strong></p>
<p>They are the same. The reason is that I am using the same data and exclusion criteria. Also, I did not use the <code>simplify()</code> function in the prior exercise. Using it, removes loops (self-nominations, or publications an author shares with him or herself. Otherwise, the diagonals would have been different.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>Tell us how or why these connections represented in this depiction are similar or different from those connections represented in deliverable 1? Would these network structures allow you to address different questions?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the coauthor network which only holds information about number of shared publications among any two co-authors. In deliverable 1, I had a more complete representation of the co-authorship data with a <em>two-mode</em> network, which not only included information about co-authorship, but on how this related to article names. As such, any questions regarding the publications themselves and not just the co-authorship information needs the two mode network. For questions pertaining only to shared authorship, the representation here is sufficient.</p>

<li><strong>Do you see any commonalities among these measures? If so, what does that mean? (go back to lecture notes and/or handbook chapter).</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are not a lot of commonalities across different centrality measures. This is because different centralities capture differnet aspects. Eigenvector centrality for example, may be high even if degree is low. For example my friend Kaitlyn Werner, has not published many papers with other coauthors (low degree, degree = 0.024), but she has co-authored papers with collaborators who are very well connected with the rest of authors (eigenvector centrality = 0.977).</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Finally, for degree centrality specify whether you are using in, out, or total and why?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I specified <code>mode = "in"</code> despite the fact that for undirected graphs that argument is ignored. If the graph were a directed graph, then using <code>mode = "total"</code> would have overestimated the degree centrality.</p>
<p>Bonus: I want to see centrality distributions. I was working on the other question, and wondered about how these look, because many seem bi-modal.</p>

<li><strong>Finally Provide an analysis of Figures 1 and 2 building upon the findings of each figure as shown in class. Specifically, address whether the use of both figures helped you gain a better understanding.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I find it hard to make deep sense of key actor analysis. In a way it feels like having different watches that provide conflicting times. I think it is helpful to think about this in concrete terms, like I did above for the case of K.M. Werner. Collaborating with many people (degree) need not agree with collaborating with people who are exceptionally well connected (eigenvector), who are the only ones who collaborated with some other author(s) (betweeness), etc.</p>

<li><strong>Replicate the two-mode interactive network visualization but relying on your publication data. Make sure you add an attribute to the nodes (articles and authors) that go beyond their number. In our examples we added Cumulative GPA, first gen. status for students and course name for courses.</strong> <strong>You can add centrality levels, for example. Make sure you add something meaningful to the line, In our case we added grade in that class. See what you can add :D.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s start by getting the graph and adding some attributes to nodes and links.</p>

<p>Moran’s I for per hour rate (<code>HrRATE90</code>) is .52, which is higher than that for fees brought in 1990 (<code>FeesCollec90</code>, Moran’s I = .46). This means that if a lawyer’s friends are charging more per hour, nad bringing in more money on fees, that particular lawyer is likely to have higher than average hour rate and fees in 1990. This effect seems to be stronger for hour rate than for fees though.</p>

<p>We see that accounting for spatial dependence, the mean is 127.9, as opposed to the raw, unadjusted mean of 154.507. The residuals from the adjusted mean controlling for dependece still show a significant moran’s test, sugggesting that the dependence issue is not yet solved (Moran’s I = -.01, p = .430)</p>

<p>We see that accounting for spatial dependence, the mean is 141650, as opposed to the raw, unadjusted mean of 176813.3. The residuals from the adjusted mean controlling for dependence no longer show a significant Moran’s test, suggesting that the dependence issue is solved for this outcome (Moran’s I = -.01, p = .446).</p>

<p>The model suggests that all the way up to 6 lags remains significant. However, there are diminishing returns, with one lag (Moran’s I = .29), and two lags (Moran’s I = .15), being higher than 3 or more lags (Moran’s I between .09 - .05)</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>If needed create a higher order weight matrix and test for autocorrelation</strong></li>

<p>Let’s keep lags all the way to 3 lagged coauthors and test for auto correlation. (This should produce the same result as <code>sp.correlogram</code>).</p>

<p>The empty model correctly addresses social dependence. The original unadjusted mean is of 1.22 publications per author. Using SAR, the mean gets adjusted down to 1.17, with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> = 0.16, meaning that for every additional publication of your co-authors, you are expected to have .16 more publications. The residuals for this model reveal no evidence for social dependence (Moran’s I = - .001, p = .543), suggesting that our residuals are now iid.</p>

<p><strong>The example shown in class measured the spatial dependence of states’ Economic Performance Rankings as of 2011. This ranking is a backward-looking measure based on a state’s performance on three important variables: Personal Income Per Capita, Absolute Domestic Migration, and Non-Farm Payroll Employment—all of which are highly influenced by state policy. This ranking details states’ individual performances over the past 10 years based on this economic data (see https://www.alec.org/app/uploads/2011/11/RSPS_4th_Edition.pdf Links to an external site., Table 8 on page 49).</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the tenth assignment you should update the results of maps 1 and 2 with the most recent information found in the Rich States Poor States 15th Edition https://www.richstatespoorstates.org/app/uploads/2022/04/2022-15th-RSPS.pdf Links to an external site.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please use the ranks provided in the table called “ALEC-Laffer State Economic Performance Rankings, 2010-2020” on page 4 to address the following questions.</strong></p>

<p>Moran’s I is 0.13 in the 1 nearest neighbor case and 0.08 for the 75 miles case.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Why would this be the case?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It seems like closer neighbors have a stronger influence, and neigbors more than 75 miles away are less important on average. This makes sense given the first law of geography: “Everything is related, but things that are closer are more related to each other than things that are far apart”. Also, the fact that we are workign with in-state tuition might make it such that crossing state lines makes the effect of other states (with different legislations and so on) more different.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Please plot the two corresponding maps</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the plot for the nearest neighbor.</p>

<h1>Final</h1>
<p>Final paper guidelines (Between 750 and 1,500 words)</p>
<p>1. Study objectives or purpose</p>
<p>• Introduction, description of the problem, motivation</p>
<p>2. Study methods or modes of inquiry</p>
<p>3. Proposed Data sources or evidence, data collection, participants</p>
<p>4. Study significance</p>
<p>• Importance of the topic</p>
<p>• The originality of the work</p>
<p>• The quality of theoretical or conceptual frameworks and data sources</p>
<p>• Soundness of the research design, analysis, and/or interpretation</p>
<p>• Evidence that the paper can be completed</p>
<p>Note: The course relies heavily on code. This may be tedious and/or frustrating for</p>
<p>some students, we have to learn to deal with frustration as we go through the exercises.</p>
<p>This is a normal process, specially for R beginners.</p>
<p>We are a learning community and as such we all should respect our opinions. Our</p>
<p>presence and participation are significant to the life of the class, to our learning, and</p>
<p>to your grade. In the case of borderline grades, your engagement in and contribution</p>
<p>to the class will be factored in.</p>
